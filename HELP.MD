## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Java 11**: You can download and install it from [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

- **Apache Maven**: Download and install Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

- **SpringBoot 2.7.16**: Make sure you have the correct version configured in your Maven `pom.xml` file.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

## Building the Application
To build the SpringBoot application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

3. Run the following Maven command to build the application:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install

##Running the Application Locally

You can run the SpringBoot application locally using the following steps:

In the terminal, navigate to the project root directory.

Run the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/your-application-name.jar
Replace your-application-name.jar with the actual name of the JAR file generated during the build.

The application will start, and you will see logs indicating that the application has started successfully.

Open a web browser and access the application at http://localhost:8080 (or the specified port if you configured it differently).

##Deploying the Application
To deploy your SpringBoot application to a production environment, follow these general steps:

Prepare a production environment, such as a cloud server or a containerized environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).

Copy the generated JAR file (target/your-application-name.jar) to the production environment.

Configure any environment-specific properties, such as database connection settings, in the application.properties or application.yml file.

Run the application on the production environment using the java -jar command, as shown in the "Running the Application Locally" section.

Set up any necessary infrastructure (e.g., a web server, load balancer, database) based on your application's requirements.

Configure security settings, backups, and monitoring as needed for your production environment.

Monitor the application and ensure it is running smoothly in the production environment.
